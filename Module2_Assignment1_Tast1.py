'''Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
'''

Num_1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
Num_2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))

Addition = Num_1 + Num_2
Subtraction = Num_1 - Num_2
Multiplication = Num_1 * Num_2
Division = Num_1 / Num_2

print("Addition: ", Addition)
print("Subtraction: ", Subtraction)
print("Multiplication: ", Multiplication)
print("Division: ", Division)
